IT'S WORKING BUT... these are possibilities of what could goes wrong:

There is 4 mayor element of the experiment, that could not work:

 - SIMULATION GAME
    - the problem itself could be very hard to train or to understand for NN
    - game mechanics could be not very reasonable on make sense

    for example: predators can be not very good at their job,
    many times the best preys in the generation are just for lucky, not for their behavior

 - OUTPUT-INPUT between Sim and Neural Network
    - it could be not clear and not understandable output from game simulation
    - interpretation of this output could be misleading

 - GENETICS METHODS
    - it could pass not the best genes but do too much mutation
    - it could be wrong writing and not working like it should do
    - or it has bad assumption: wrong mutation limit, wrong number od randomness etc

 - NEURAL NETWORK
    - it could be wrong writing and not working like it should do
    - or it's size: number of layers or neurons is not correct
