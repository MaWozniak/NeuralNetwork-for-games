- 3 different Simulation scenario -

A) main - prey + predators + hide places + feed places;

B) simplify - only prey + predators - energy don't decrease -
We teach prey to avoid predators ONLY!

C) simplify 2 - only prey + feedeing places + additional energy (aging factor)
to remove static preys in feed area over the time -
We teach prey to feed in feed places ONLY!

Add some kind of bonus for active prey - to avoid passing through prey that don't move
Maybe food can be placed in many small pieces on the board

0.1) check Memory (RAM) - for 1000 generations etc? Is Garbage Collector doing good job? ;)

0.2) REFACTOR Generation, GenerationMemory, Scoring etc + refactor Input and Outputs in NeuralNetwork

2) Activation Function don't work well? all scores is simillar to 0.5(?)
more tests + check different activation function (none, exponens, sinul, relu etc.)

3) write Genomes(arrays of weights and biases) of all preyAI to file (to save progress)

-experiment with diffrents Activation Function for Neural Network ( ReLU - Rectified Linear Unit!)

-remove /build and /gradle from remote repository

-refactor code to be more SOLID, more Atomic, meaningful names
