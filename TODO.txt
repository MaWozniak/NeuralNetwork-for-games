-separate game loop and jFrame loop (graphics)
different frame rate for graphics and game

//! everything important is in OrganismGenerator -> there should be a game thread with for example 10FPS
//and in Game it's should only be a graphics plus methods that's import data from OrganismGenerator
//GUI can had for example 30FPS

-enhance board - places to hide, places to feed, borders etc

-add Predators - logic to Eat a pray
(add energy after consume, don't eat when it's full more than 90% energy etc)
! FIELD OF VIEW - visibility concept - predators and pray doesn't see all board or all others organism
it's only see about for example 15 points in front of it

-Predators cannot walk in to the middle-board, it's safe area for the Prey like deep wood or smth

-refactor code to be more SOLID, more Atomic, meaningful names

-class Organism which other organism will be inherit
//void move, paint, eat, dead etc

-class Simulation where is static main function - here we construct OrganismGenerator with own thread and fps
and Visual class (our jFrame GUI)

TO DO
-list of predator(3)
-class Animal
-Predator slow in gray, fast in white, energy only by eating
-Prey energy only by green, faster lose on white, slightly slower on white

-SOLID cleaning - class GUI and class Game(OrganismCon.. on Simulation main)
-simply AI to see how they can behave

-add Neural network with genetic progresion and first dummy Real-AI Prey, next Real-AI Predators (different colors to compare)
