-separate renderPanel loop and jFrame loop (graphics)
different frame rate for graphics and renderPanel

//! everything important is in OrganismGenerator -> there should be a renderPanel thread with for example 10FPS
//and in Main.RenderPanel it's should only be a graphics plus methods that's import data from OrganismGenerator
//Main.GUI can had for example 30FPS

-enhance board - places to hide, places to feed, borders etc

-add Predators - logic to Eat a pray
(add energy after consume, don't eat when it's full more than 90% energy etc)
! FIELD OF VIEW - visibility concept - predators and pray doesn't see all board or all others organism
it's only see about for example 15 points in front of it

-Predators cannot walk in to the middle-board, it's safe area for the Main.Prey like deep wood or smth

-refactor code to be more SOLID, more Atomic, meaningful names

-class Main.Organism which other organism will be inherit
//void move, paint, eat, dead etc

-class Main.Simulation where is static Main function - here we construct OrganismGenerator with own thread and fps
and Visual class (our jFrame Main.GUI)

TO DO
-list of predator(3)
-class Animal
-Main.Predator slow in gray, fast in white, energy only by eating
-Main.Prey energy only by green, faster lose on white, slightly slower on white

-SOLID cleaning - class Main.GUI and class Main.RenderPanel(OrganismCon.. on Main.Simulation Main)
-simply AI to see how they can behave

-add Neural network with genetic progresion and first dummy Real-AI Main.Prey, next Real-AI Predators (different colors to compare)
