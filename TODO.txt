0.1) check Memory (RAM) - for 1000 generations etc? Is Garbage Collector doing good job? ;)

0.2) REFACTOR Generation, GenerationMemory, Scoring etc + refactor Input and Outputs in NeuralNetwork

1) FAST create 11 points of view for every Organism (now it is 3-5)
first in Gui, next in model;

2) Activation Function don't work well? all scores is simillar to 0.5(?)
more tests + check different activation function (none, exponens, sinul, relu etc.)

3) write Genomes(arrays of weights and biases) of all preyAI to file (to save progress)

-experiment with diffrents Activation Function for Neural Network ( ReLU - Rectified Linear Unit!)

-Predators when came to borders has too fast reaction (change direction -100%)

-remove /build and /gradle from remote repository

-refactor code to be more SOLID, more Atomic, meaningful names
