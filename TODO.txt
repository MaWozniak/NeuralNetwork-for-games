-separate game loop and jFrame loop (graphics)
different frame rate for graphics and game

//! everything important is in OrganismGenerator -> there should be a game thread with for example 10FPS
//and in Game it's should only be a graphics plus methods that's import data from OrganismGenerator
//GUI can had for example 30FPS

-enhance board - places to hide, places to feed, borders etc

-add Predators - logic to Eat a pray
(add energy after consume, don't eat when it's full more than 90% energy etc)
! FIELD OF VIEW - visibility concept - predators and pray doesn't see all board or all others organism
it's only see about for example 15 points in front of it

-Predators cannot walk in to the middle-board, it's safe area for the Prey like deep wood or smth

-refactor code to be more SOLID, more Atomic, meaningful names
